### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing master degree in data science at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 

I am interested in big data development and application of machine learning methods. From Jul. 2020 to Jul 2021, I worked for Meituan, China's largest food delivery platform, as Machine Learning Engineer and developed recommendation systems there. I enjoy the process of creating something interesting and useful for people and love to conquer challenges.

I am looking for software engineer and machine learning engineer positions in USA! Please contact me via email zelongjiang@outlook.com or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zelong-zane-jiang-49b388168/) if you would like to know more about me!
