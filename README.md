### Hi there 👋

Some facts about me:

👨‍🎓 I am senior software engineer located in Santa Clara, California, working for Sonatus on some exciting projects including live-streaming data dashboards, real-time vehicle data processing and MQTT communications. 

🥑 I take great interest in big data and all related applications, such as large-scale machine learning systems, distributed data storage, stream data processing and cloud computing. I am familiar with several programming languages, including Java, Python, C++ and Go.

🐼 I have lots of hands-on experience in industrial pojects with Spark, Flink, Kafka, Redis and GraphQL. From Jul. 2020 to Jul 2021, I worked for Meituan, China's largest food delivery platform, as Machine Learning Engineer and developed recommendation systems there.
