### Hi there 👋

Some facts about me:

👨‍🎓 I am currently pursuing master degree in data science at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 

🥑 I am interested in big data development and application of machine learning methods. I am familiar with several programming languages, including Java, Python, Go, Scala and C++. Java and Python are preferred. 

🐼 I have lots of hands-on experience in industrial pojects with Spark, Flink, Kafka and Spring. From Jul. 2020 to Jul 2021, I worked for Meituan, China's largest food delivery platform, as Machine Learning Engineer and developed recommendation systems there.

🥰 I enjoy the process of creating something interesting and useful for people and love to conquer challenges.
