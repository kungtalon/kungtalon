### Hi there 👋

Some facts about me:

👨‍🎓 I am currently pursuing master degree in data science at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 

🥑 I take great interest in big data and all related applications, such as large-scale machine learing systems, distributed data storage, stream data processing and cloud data warehousing. I am familiar with several programming languages, including Java, Python, C++ and Go.
